<h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
	<p> The purpose of this lab was to begin our journey into javascript (sort of),
		and begin the process of learning how to psuedocode!
		</p>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
		<p> I feel as if this whole lab was a difficulty because neither my partner or myself
			knew exactly how it was supposed to look after being pasted into the "lab.js" index
			or in the html. The best part was just making the lists.
			</p>

	<h2>Result of Our Work</h2>
		<p> Overall, I believe the lab is done efficently and correct, but I am curious
			to see in class how exactly it is supposed to look, or if we strayed way far from the
				correct format.
