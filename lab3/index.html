	<h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		<p>
			The focus of this lab was to create a homepage for this class, and send the
		browser to GitHub to make sure that it posted properly.</p>
		<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
			<p>
				I did not encounter any difficulties, but putting the border did cause me
			some problem when trying to put it solely around my photo.</p>

		<h2>Result of Our Work</h2>
			<p>
				Overall this lab was simple, and the thurough instructions made it
				clear excatly what we were supposed to be doing step by step.</p>
