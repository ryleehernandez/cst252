    <h2> Challenge </h2>
<p> In this lab we experimented with adding in a button and having having it display the results
  tht were typed in. </p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
<p> My partner and I encountered a lot of problems within this lab. My main problem being that my JavaScript file
  would not connect to my HTML file, basically rendering my whole labn useless because I could not test anything within it.


    <h2> Results </h2>
This lab is not thouroghly complete.
