      <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
    <p> In this lab we experimented with anonymous functions and callbacks while using
    the console log in google, and then transferring the data to atom. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
      <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
    <p> My partner and I did not come across any major problems within this lab. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
      <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
    <p> I believe that we did everything in the lab correctly, and it all appeared into
    my HTML file. </p>
