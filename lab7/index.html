<h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
<p> In this lab we experimented with writing functions in order to rpoduce a string. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
<p> My partner and I did not have any major erroes within this lab. My Atom console,
has been acting strange the whole time while using this lab, turning all my code white, and
not properly fuctioning.  </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Results of Lab </h2>
<p> I believe that as we continue to work on this, it will continue to get easier. </p>
