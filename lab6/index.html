		<h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
	<p> In this lab we experimented declaring variables, arrays, and objects within JavaScript.
	First we started with the Google JavaScrpt console, and then put everything back into
	Atom. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
		<h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
	<p> My partner and I did not have any major erroes within this lab, only small
	things such as forgetting a colon/comma, but was quickly caught after reviewing our work.x </p>
	<br>
	<br>
		<h2> Results of Lab </h2>
	<p> I believe that we did everything in the lab correctly, and it all appeared into
	my HTML file. </p>
