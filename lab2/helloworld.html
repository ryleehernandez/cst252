<h2> Me: </h2>
<p> My name is Rylee and I love going to the beach and trying new food places!
   I am currently a junior majoring in Communication Design with an emphasis on web design.
    I have a lab/shepard mix named Klover who is 3 years old, and I love taking her on hikes
    around my town. The goal for after I graduate is to became a social media manager for a company
    but preferably in the fashion industry! </p>

<h2> My partner, Raven: </h2>
<p> My name is Raven and I like to draw and play video games. I am in my 4th year
  (but not yet a senior) majoring in communication design with a focus on Game Design.
   Some of my favorite video games are Pokemon, Left 4 Dead, and Castlevania.
   It is a a goal of mine to one day become an independent video game developer and publish a game.
   I work part-time (though it feels like full-time) at Michael's the craft store. </p>
