      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p> In this lab, we experimented with using Javascript classes and having it display
      within the html file.</p>

      <h2> Problems</h2>
      <p> Overall, my partner and I did not experience any significant problems, and
      this lab went very smoothly. The work that we did in class helped a lot. </p>
